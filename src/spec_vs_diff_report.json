  "summary": "REQ-1 is not implemented: both ICP and non-ICP Home pages still use hardcoded hero image asset paths (now image-6/7/8) rather than dynamically showing the last 3 user-uploaded images. The diff also introduces/updates unrelated project metadata and a broad frontend change summary not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "Both HomePage files still define a static `heroImages` array with fixed `/assets/image-6.png`, `/assets/image-7.png`, `/assets/image-8.png` sources; there is no evidence of fetching/deriving the last 3 uploaded images or wiring them into the hero section.",

      "requirement": "No broken images (no 404s) in the hero section for either ICP or non-ICP builds using the newly provided last-3 uploaded images.",
      "reason": "Because the hero is not wired to the 'last 3 uploaded images' at all (still static assets), the acceptance criterion about using the newly provided uploads cannot be verified/fulfilled from the diff.",
