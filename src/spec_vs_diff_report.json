  "summary": "REQ-1 cannot be confirmed from the provided (truncated) Layout.tsx diff; the visible changes largely add new error-boundary/safe-wrapper behavior and update project metadata/summaries with unrelated claims.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the shared public Layout so the global site header is not rendered on /admin-panel/* routes, while keeping the header visible on all other routes (including /admin login).",
      "reason": "The provided Layout.tsx diff is truncated before any conditional rendering logic is shown. While `useLocation` is imported, the excerpt only shows new error boundary and safe wrapper components; no evidence is shown that Header rendering is actually conditioned on paths starting with \"/admin-panel\" (and not on \"/admin\").",

    {
      "description": "Added a layout-specific Error Boundary with custom fallback UI (\"Layout Error\", reload button, dev-only error details).",
      "reason": "Not requested; the BuildRequest only asks to hide the global Header on /admin-panel/* routes.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added SafeHeader/SafeFooter wrappers that catch render errors and display fallback UI (e.g., \"Header failed to load\", \"Footer failed to load\").",
      "reason": "Not requested; also introduces new user-facing text and changes header/footer failure behavior beyond hiding the header on specific routes.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Wrapped Outlet in Suspense with a global loading UI (\"Loading page...\") and additional fallback error UI (\"Page Error\").",

    {
      "description": "Updated/introduced project metadata describing additional feature requests (e.g., replacing header/footer logos site-wide) beyond hiding the header on /admin-panel/* routes.",

    {
      "description": "Modified frontend-file-summaries.txt to claim numerous unrelated UI/routing/logo changes (e.g., new /control/site-settings route, new uploaded logo, multiple page redesign/animation changes).",
      "reason": "Not requested by the BuildRequest; and these claims are not supported by the actual code diffs shown (only Layout.tsx + metadata/summaries are modified in this diff summary).",
